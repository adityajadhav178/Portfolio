                            <p>
                                Growing up in Miraj within a lively joint family of ten, I was immersed in a nurturing environment that fostered my academic brilliance from a young age. My early years were marked by a strong drive to excel in studies, and like many in India, I dreamed of becoming a cricketer. In 2012, my fascination with music was sparked by the energetic song "Chinta Ta Ta Chita Chita" from the movie Rowdy Rathore. This led me to explore percussion, and I eagerly took up tabla classes to cultivate this newfound passion

                                After clearing a rigorous entrance exam, I joined G.D. Sainik School, Tasgaon, a prestigious hostel school that had long been my childhood dream. Although I had to set aside my tabla and cricket pursuits, I continued to enjoy cricket during game periods. At the school, I embraced the discipline and developed essential skills such as leadership and time management, which are core to the Sainik education

                                My dedication to academics remained unwavering, leading me to secure the top position in the school and sixth in the district in the 8th-grade scholarship exam. I further excelled in my 10th-grade board exams with an impressive 96.60%. However, upon completing 10th grade, I decided to leave the school, as my aspiration was to pursue a career as an engineer rather than become an army officer.

                            <p>
                                Determined to tackle one of the worldâ€™s toughest exams, I joined Shraddha Career Development Academy to prepare for the JEE. This period was one of the most challenging phases of my career, marked by relentless study and dedication. Despite my hard work and achieving a 99.08 percentile, it wasn't enough to secure admission into my dream institute and branch. As the saying goes, "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."

                                After clearing the MHT-CET, I was admitted to COEP Technological University, one of Maharashtra's premier institutions. Here, I pursued Computer Engineering, which was my preferred branch and aligned with my career aspirations.

                                Initially, overconfidence led me to neglect my studies in the first semester, resulting in poor grades. This was a significant wake-up call, prompting me to refocus and improve my academic performance in the following semesters

                                In the 4th semester, I concentrated on developing various skills, which unfortunately impacted my grades. These experiences have taught me valuable lessons about maintaining a balance between skill development and academic responsibilities. Moving forward, I am committed to applying these lessons to achieve a more balanced and successful approach in both my studies and career.
